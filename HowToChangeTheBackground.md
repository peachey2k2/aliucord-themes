# How to Change the Background for a Theme
First, upload the image you want to use to somewhere. The easiest option is to use Discord itself, which is what I'll show.

**Note: Make sure the image fits your entire screen, or it'll either be stretched or leave black stripes. You'll probably need to crop it in that case.**

Click on the image, then copy its link.

Go to settings tab, then go to your plugins. Search for themer and go to its settings.

Find your theme, click on the pencil icon, then open up the background panel.

Here, you can put the link you copied to the URL box to use it as a background.

There are a few more things I should mention:

`overlay_alpha` lets you change the opacity of the overlay color in front of the background. It goes from 0 to 255, 255 being fully opaque, completely hiding the background image.

`blur_radius` lets you blur the background. Goes from 0 to 25.
