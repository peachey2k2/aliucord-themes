# aliucord-themes
The themes I have made for Aliucord, an alternative mobile discord client.

[Here](https://github.com/peachey2k2/aliucord-themes/blob/main/HowToChangeTheBackground.md) is a guide on how to change the background image.

[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DCqM_HFDXzuN5HZyOoxQ7r8xrfgB3lnX) are the backgrounds I have used so far. Liked em, they are great for me and you might like them too. Though if you're gonna use them, make sure to increase the alpha too, or they'll appear too bright.
